# Terminal Portfolio Website

A [personal website](https://terminal.techytimms.com/) for James Timms using a terminal-like interface to display my CV (resume). A modern, interactive terminal-based website that serves as both a showcase of my skills and an engaging experience for visitors. The website simulates a command-line interface from the 90s where users can type commands to navigate my portfolio, view my projects, and learn about my experience.

Uses React, TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Router, and TailwindCSS.

## Set up

```
git clone git@github.com:JamesTimms/web-terminal.git
cd web-terminal
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
