# Terminal Portfolio Website

A personal website for James Timms using a terminal-like interface to display my CV (resume). A modern, interactive terminal-based website that serves as both a showcase of my skills and an engaging experience for visitors. The website simulates a command-line interface from the 90s where users can type commands to navigate my portfolio, view my projects, and learn about my experience.
